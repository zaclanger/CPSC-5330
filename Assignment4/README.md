#Assignment 4 - Countdown Timer App

Zachary Langer
CPSC 5330

This is a simple app that displays the current time/date at the top of the screen and provides a timer that counts down from a value selected by the user via a UIDatePicker. Below the DatePicker is a button to start/stop the timer, as well as to stop the music when the timer completes. Below that is a display of the current time remaining on the timer.

In addition, the background changes between a lighter and darker image based on the time of day (AM is lighter, PM is darker).
